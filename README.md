# frictional_melt_roughness
Undergraduate thesis, Wesleyan University. I study the generation of frictional melt at seismogenic shear zones. Specifically, I use numerical models, optimization, and Monte Carlo sampling to constrain the shear stress statistics and the kinematic parameters of the slip rate function.
